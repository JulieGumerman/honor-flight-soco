We are currently accepting application to veterans from WWII, Korea, and Vietnam,  as well as terminally ill veterans from all wars. <br><br>

Honor Flight of Southern Colorado provides trained guardian who escort our veterans, offering assistance for a safe, memorable and rewarding journey. Spouses cannot travel with the veterans unless they are also veterans or are between the ages of 18-70 years old. Family guardians are limited to one person per veteran.     </p>

Honor Flight of Southern Colorado is a volunteer program created to honor our veterans for all they have sacrificed to make this a better world. Without the support of these volunteers, there is no way that we would be able to provide the opportunity to fly our heroes to Washington, D.C. to see the memorials created in their honor.<br><br>

Guardians escort and assist veterans, traveling with them to and around Washington, D.C. Guardians must be able to lift 50 pounds and be capable of pushing a wheelchair for a mile. This trip is impossible without you! Thank you for your help in advance. </p>

Examples of volunteer positions include sending off the veterans at the airport in the morning and welcoming them home at the end of the trip with a cheering reception; entering application info into the data system; mailing requested material and purchased merchandise; as well as contacting veterans and guardians to make arrangements based on our projected flight schedules.<br><br>

If you would like to volunteer your services, please contact us. You can be a part of making our veterans' dreams a reality. You can make a difference. Thank you for your support.   </p>
